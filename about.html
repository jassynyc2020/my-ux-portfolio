            <h1>Hi, my name is Nishi "Nisha".</h1>
            <p>I'm a UX UI designer based in Indiana, currently 
                attending Kenzie Academy where I will be 
                receiving my Certificate for UI Design Engineering in
                October, 2020.<br><br>
                Currently, I'm working part-time as an Apple Technical Advisor for Apple.
                Prior to this, I was in sales. First as a registered sales
                assistant for Deutsche Bank and then
                as a virtual executive assistant / social media manager for 
                Deaf Kids Code.<br><br>
                I'm excited by using my love for the creative arts and 
                business to build mobile apps that people love.<br</br>
                Beyond designing, I enjoy abstract painting and drawing, 
                blogging about UX UI design, writing stories and exploring
                remote regions around the world.</p>
